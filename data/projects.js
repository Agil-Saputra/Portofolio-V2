    description: "In this project, I have developed an E-commerce App using Next.js. The app has complete functionality, including a cart feature that utilizes React Context API to pass state to the parent and other components. To persist the cart data, I have implemented Local Storage. Additionally, I have integrated a Contentful Headless Content Management System to facilitate easy product management. For creating a user-friendly interface, I have combined two CSS frameworks, Tailwind CSS and Material UI, resulting in an intuitive and interactive UI. To handle payments, I have incorporated Stripe as the chosen payment gateway, ensuring smooth and secure transactions for shipping the selected products.",
